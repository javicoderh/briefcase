# Getting Started with Create React App

### this is a prev version of my briefcase it has an index with three sections, one with scrum methodology content
 one with dragon's dreaming methodology and a galleries section, they aren't finished, this is just a preview of the briefcase style and routing work
 the first page has an auth routing aplication, asking the visitors to signup or login using google. if you login it will drive you to a
 welcome message with a link to the index page, otherwise you will be redirected to the first login page
 on the projects section there is a little project using useState, useEffect and Material UI,
